== Building

To run your application please complete the Auth parameters in MainVerticle:

```
mvn clean compile exec:java
```

The application should throw an Exception:
```
Index cursor cannot have transaction state with values and without values simultaneously
```

This exception appears only for Neo4j 4.1.5-enterprise edition, it means that it works correctly on 4.1.5-community
